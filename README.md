## Overview

This repository showcases the work Iâ€™ve done from the start of my university journey to the present. Here, you'll find projects written in Python, SAS, R, and even SPSS. The aim is to document my learning progress and to provide a resource for anyone interested in my work or learning from my code.

## Languages, Technologies, and Tools

### Current Languages Taught at UT

- **Python**: Data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning projects utilizing libraries like pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.
- **SAS**: Data processing, statistical analysis, and data visualization using SAS.
- **SPSS**: Statistical analysis using T-tests, ANOVA, and regression models.
- **R**: (Coming Soon) Statistical computing, data analysis, and visualization using libraries.

### Tools/Software Used

- Base SAS 9.4
- Microsoft Visual Studio Code
- RStudio
- SPSS

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **/Data Science I**: Projects and assignments from the introductory Data Science course, including work in Python, SAS and SPSS.
- **/Introduction to CSET**: Basic Python projects and exercises covering syntax, control structures, functions, and introductory use of libraries.
- **/Data Science II**: (Coming Soon) Advanced projects involving Python and R focused on machine learning and advanced statistical analysis.
